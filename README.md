# Car-Price-Prediction---Python
This is a Machine Learning Project which implements two different learning models, and figuring out the better model by comparing the performance of those models.
The data sources were collected from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho
(1) Car details v3.csv (renamed it to Car_price_1.csv), (2) CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv (renamed it to Car_price_2.csv)
The first algorithm used is Linear Regression, and the second algorithm is Random Forest Regression.
Because the performance of both models were low, added Pipelines to both models and improved the performance.
